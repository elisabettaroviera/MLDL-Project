# This file is part of the datasets package
# This file is empty, we have to implement it!

# Asking GitHub Copilot for help
"""
elisabettaroviera: Hi! In this file __init__.py, what I have to write inside?

GitHub Copilot: The content of the __init__.py file depends on the purpose of the datasets package. Here are some common use cases:

### 1. **Marking the Directory as a Package**
If you don't need any specific functionality, you can leave the file empty. This simply marks the datasets directory as a Python package.

```python
# Empty file
```

---

### 2. **Importing Modules or Classes**
If you want to make certain modules or classes available directly when importing the datasets package, you can import them here. For example:

```python
from .dataset1 import Dataset1
from .dataset2 import Dataset2

__all__ = ["Dataset1", "Dataset2"]
```

This allows you to do:
```python
from datasets import Dataset1, Dataset2
```

---

### 3. **Dynamic Imports or Initialization**
If you need to perform some initialization logic or dynamically load modules, you can add that logic here. For example:

```python
import os

print(f"Initializing the datasets package. Path: {os.path.dirname(__file__)}")
```

---

### 4. **Exposing Metadata**
You can also use the __init__.py file to define metadata for the package:

```python
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "Your Name"
```

---

Let me know if you need help implementing any of these!
