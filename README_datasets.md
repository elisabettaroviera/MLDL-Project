In this folder I placed the .zip file downloaded from the link in the README.md file.

For further use, perhaps for the report, I just add a brief description of these two datasets.

**Cityscapes**. - For more details, see Paper 5 (The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding)
Cityscapes is a large-scale dataset for semantic segmentation, collected from 50 European cities from a vehicle's perspective. It includes 5,000 high-quality pixel-level annotated images (2,975 for training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing), along with an additional 20,000 coarsely annotated images often used for pre-training to improve model generalization. Images have a high resolution of 2048×1024 pixels. Evaluation focuses on 19 semantic classes grouped into 7 super-categories (ground, construction, object, nature, sky, human, vehicle), excluding the void label. While the test set’s ground truth was initially withheld for fair benchmarking via an online server, it is now publicly available.

**GTA5**.
GTA5 is a synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation, consisting of 24,966 high-resolution (1914×1052) images collected from the video game Grand Theft Auto V. The dataset provides pixel-wise annotations across 33 classes, with 19 classes aligned to the Cityscapes categories for standard evaluation. Images are captured by recording every 40th frame during gameplay, ensuring a wide variety of urban scenes. GTA5 enables effective domain adaptation research, as models trained on it are commonly adapted and evaluated on real-world datasets like Cityscapes.

**IMPORTANT**
In the event that these links could not be used correctly, due to overloading in the download of the datasets, I created a drive where I uploaded them so that, by just changing the previous links with these, we could access them at any time.
